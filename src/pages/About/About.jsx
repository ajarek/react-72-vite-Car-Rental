        Our service is popular with people who need a temporary vehicle for
        various reasons, such as travel, business trips or when their own car is
        in the workshop for repair. The car rental company offers a variety of
        vehicles to suit different needs and budgets, from economy cars to
        luxury cars and SUVs. Rental rates may vary based on factors such as car
        type, rental time and rental location. We require tenants to have a
        valid driver's license, credit card and at least 21 years of age and an
        international driving license for foreign tenants. Renting a car can be
        a convenient and economical way to get around, especially when exploring
        a new city or country. However, it's important to read the lease
        carefully, understand the terms, and ask any questions before signing.
        It is also important to thoroughly inspect the vehicle before driving to
        ensure that any pre-existing damage is noted and to avoid liability.
        Overall, car hire can provide a practical solution to temporary
        transportation needs, offering flexibility and convenience to travelers
        and residents alike.
